            <p>You can see that i love discovering new things related to it and so i am constantly trying to learn new language or new way of thinking</p>
            <p>as you can see i have more than the basics on a lot a language, its not because i want to be a expert developper soon but its more likely to help me for my studies and my personal life goal trying various language will only help me to think with more ease in each of them and make me realise wich one I want to work on</p>
            <p>with this fresh portfolio that i will work to upgrade each time there is news on my professional life you will have almost every important information and if you need more you can contact me on my professional mail in the bottom of the page</p>
